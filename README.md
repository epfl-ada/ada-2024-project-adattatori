# All you need is loveü´Ç ‚Ä¶ and a good chemical affinityüß™

## Abstract
As social beings, we humans tend to create meaningful romantic relationships. Nevertheless, jumping into this boat implies assuming the many risks that come along with the decision of being part of a couple. Amongst these numerous risks, a generalized one is related to infections and viral transmissions between the individuals concerned. Emblematically, sexually transmitted infections and subsequent diseases (STDs) are a representative example of this, to the extent that the World Health Organisation still recognises them as a prominent problem, integrating their potential eradication in its 2030 agenda purposes [1]. 
However, not only humans live their life in couples but so do chemical compounds, which are created with the only purpose and sole aim of belonging to their future partner: ‚Äútheir target protein‚Äù. 
With this project we are keen to see how ‚Äúcouples‚Äù in the chemical domain strive to combat this aforementioned human problem, contributing to the health of human relationships. Thus, we would like to trace development of the drugs against STDs, with a particular focus on HIV, and try to depict the main changes in drug affinity for their targets over time. We will embark on a quest to seek similarities in the ligands that can better predict affinity and therefore show the tip of the iceberg of the enormous potential that chemical binding has to pursue this aim.

## Research Questions
- How many different types of target proteins for HIV are in BindingDB?
- Which structures do the ligands with high affinty have in common?

## Proposed dataset

We will not be using any additional datasets for our analysis. We consider that BindingDB provides us with the necessary information to carry out our project proposal.


## Methods

**Part 1: Preparing and cleaning the dataset** 

- Step 1: After inspection of the original BindingDB dataset, we build the master dataset selecting only rows (ligand-target interactions) that are linked to STDs. We manually inspect the target source organisms and selected those related to STDs. 

- Step 2: Cleaning the dataset: This step is crucial for obtaining interpretable results in the next parts. In order to do so, we plotted the availability of binding affinity metrics, and seeing that IC50 was the most abundant one, we selected only rows with IC50 available values. Then we removed rows were NaN values were too abundant.

- Step 3: General exploration of this dataset and selection of HIV, as this immunodeficient disease proved to be the one on which we had the most data available.

**Part 2: Focusing on HIV: ligand-target couples**

- Step 1: Analysis of target proteins in HIV: these are the elements that we use to attack this virus. Plot of the different types we found and their frequencies

- Step 2:

- Step 3: Study the structure of ligands in detail, thanks to the Python Rdkit library (after an additional cleaning). Extraction of molecular features from the SMILES string permitted us to study the correlation between these features and binding affinity. For now, we have not uncovered any significant relationships. This might lead to further exploration of other features for P3 and other Rdkit functionalities. Furthermore, we performed K-means clustering on the similarity matrix of fingerprints.


## Organization of the repository
The structure of our repository is the following:
```
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ data                        <- BindingSTD dataset
‚îÇ
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ src                         <- Source code
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ data                            <- Data directory 
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ models                          <- Model directory
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ utils                           <- Utility directory
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ scripts                         <- Shell scripts
‚îÇ
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ tests                       <- Complete performed analysis
‚îÇ
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ results.ipynb               <- Notebook showing our results
‚îÇ
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ environment.yml             <- File for installing python dependencies
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md
```
In the 'utils' folder there are 3 files: 'data_utils.py' contains the functions that can be applied to the dataset to format it in a usable shape; 'evaluation_utils.py' contains the functions used to plot the results.
In the 'tests' folder we added all the analysis and explorations that we performed.  
The 'result.ipynb' main file consists for now of the exploratory data analysis that has been performed in the scope of milestone 2.
In 'environment.yml' file there are all the python dependicies needed to run our code.
